# Federated Learning Privacy Evaluation

This project explores privacy vulnerabilities in Federated Learning, such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), and implements defense mechanisms like Differential Privacy and Dropout.

The system includes:
- A **React** frontend to configure and visualize training
- A **FastAPI** backend to manage the federated learning pipeline
- A **Dockerized** environment for consistent and reproducible deployment
